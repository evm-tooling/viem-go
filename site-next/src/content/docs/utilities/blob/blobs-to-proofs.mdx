# blobsToProofs

Computes KZG proofs for a list of blobs and their commitments using a KZG implementation.

### Import

<CodeGroup
  tabs={[
    {
      title: "Go",
      language: "go",
      code: `import "github.com/ChefBingbong/viem-go/utils/blob"
import "github.com/ChefBingbong/viem-go/utils/kzg"`,
      showLineNumbers: false
    }
  ]}
/>

### Usage

<CodeGroup
  tabs={[
    {
      title: "Go",
      language: "go",
      code: `import "github.com/ChefBingbong/viem-go/utils/blob"
import "github.com/ChefBingbong/viem-go/utils/kzg"

blobs, _ := blob.ToBlobs([]byte("hello world"))
commitments, _ := blob.BlobsToCommitments(blobs, kzgImpl)

// Compute proofs
proofs, err := blob.BlobsToProofs(blobs, commitments, kzgImpl)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Get proofs as hex strings
hexProofs, err := blob.BlobsToProofsHex(blobs, commitments, kzgImpl)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}`,
      showLineNumbers: false
    }
  ]}
/>

### Returns

- **Type:** `([][]byte, error)` for `BlobsToProofs`, `([]string, error)` for `BlobsToProofsHex`

An array of KZG proofs, one for each blob. Each proof is 48 bytes.

### Parameters

### blobs (required)

- **Type:** `[][]byte`

The blobs to compute proofs for. Must have the same length as `commitments`.

<CodeGroup
  tabs={[
    {
      title: "Go",
      language: "go",
      code: `blobs, _ := blob.ToBlobs([]byte("hello world"))
commitments, _ := blob.BlobsToCommitments(blobs, kzgImpl)
proofs, _ := blob.BlobsToProofs(blobs, commitments, kzgImpl)`,
      showLineNumbers: false
    }
  ]}
/>

### commitments (required)

- **Type:** `[][]byte`

The KZG commitments corresponding to the blobs. Must have the same length as `blobs`.

<CodeGroup
  tabs={[
    {
      title: "Go",
      language: "go",
      code: `commitments, _ := blob.BlobsToCommitments(blobs, kzgImpl)
proofs, _ := blob.BlobsToProofs(blobs, commitments, kzgImpl)`,
      showLineNumbers: false
    }
  ]}
/>

### kzgImpl (required)

- **Type:** `kzg.Kzg`

The KZG implementation to use for computing proofs.

<CodeGroup
  tabs={[
    {
      title: "Go",
      language: "go",
      code: `proofs, _ := blob.BlobsToProofs(blobs, commitments, kzgImpl)`,
      showLineNumbers: false
    }
  ]}
/>

### Functions

### BlobsToProofs

Computes proofs from blobs and commitments:

```go
proofs, _ := blob.BlobsToProofs(blobs, commitments, kzgImpl)
```

### BlobsToProofsHex

Computes proofs and returns them as hex strings:

```go
hexProofs, _ := blob.BlobsToProofsHex(blobs, commitments, kzgImpl)
```

### BlobsHexToProofs

Computes proofs from hex-encoded blobs and commitments:

```go
proofs, _ := blob.BlobsHexToProofs(hexBlobs, hexCommitments, kzgImpl)
```

### BlobsHexToProofsHex

Computes hex proofs from hex blobs and commitments:

```go
hexProofs, _ := blob.BlobsHexToProofsHex(hexBlobs, hexCommitments, kzgImpl)
```

### Notes

- Each proof is 48 bytes (384 bits)
- Proofs are used to verify that a blob matches its commitment
- The number of proofs equals the number of blobs
- `blobs` and `commitments` must have the same length
